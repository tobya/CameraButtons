Script Control for Aver 520 Pro Camera
---

This laravel/php commandline app allows you to control Atem Pro 520 via its web interface.

I should be able to control this camera  via PTZ but doesnt seem to work for some reason.

I use it with Bitfocus Companion and a Stream Deck to send commands to the camara during a live shoot.
